<h1>Restaurants</h1>

<ul>
<li>Dar Poeta, Vicolo del Bologna 45, Trastevere - best pizza in 
Rome, therefore best pizza in the world. also, amazing calzone 
with nutella and ricotta (thick crust pizza)</li>
<li>La Montecarlo, Vicolo Savelli, 13 - it&rsquo;s the perfect 
all-rounder for anyone in the city center. a few steps away from 
Argentina, this place serves very good fritti, pastas and 
pizzas.</li>
<li>Gatta Mangiona, Via Federico Ozanam, 30 - close to the end 
of the tram number 8, this place doesn&rsquo;t have tourists and 
has some of the best pizza variations in town. highly 
recommended.</li>
<li>Da Remo, Piazza di Santa Maria Liberatrice, 44 - serving the 
quintessential Roman style pizza, this place is a must for 
getting the real roman experience</li>
<li>Dal Paino, Via di Parione, 34 - it belongs to the son of the 
Bafetto owner. the pizza is the same but the line is 
shorter.</li>
<li>La Focaccia, Via della Pace 11, close to Piazza Navona</li>
<li>La Pratolina, Via degli Scipioni 248, close to Castel 
Sant'Angelo - they serve an old roman style pizza called 
&ldquo;pinsa&rdquo;. it&rsquo;s oval and with a thick crust but 
the ingredients are very good and make it delicious in the 
overall</li>
<li>Novecento, Via dei Conciatori 14, close to Metro Station 
Piramide - my favourite restaurant in Rome. doesn&rsquo;t have 
tourists and the ricotta mousse is one of the best desserts 
I&rsquo;ve had in my life</li>
<li>Felice, Via Mastro Giorgio, 29 - very good food and rather 
famous place in Testaccio. a little expensive and reservation is 
mandatory</li>
<li>Da Bucatino. Via Luca Della Robbia, 84 - traditional Roman 
food. probably the best place to eat it. the &ldquo;coda alla 
vaccinara&rdquo; is delicious but they have a whole range of 
traditional roman dishes.</li>
<li>Da Augusto, Piazza de' Renzi 15, Trastevere - traditional 
Roman food in a typical Osteria. menu changes everyday and the 
food tastes home made! usually has a line at the door</li>
<li>Taverna del Moro, Vicolo de' Cinque 36, Trastevere - an 
overall good place for italian food. could be a restaurant back 
in our hometown&hellip; but better. way better! :)</li>
<li>Da Tonino, Via del Governo Vecchio 18, close to Piazza 
Navona - generic italian food. try the &ldquo;melanzane&rdquo; 
(aubergine) which is very good but save room for the 
carbonara</li>
<li>Er Buchetto, Via del Viminale 2G, close to Termini - a place 
to eat the traditional &ldquo;porchetta&rdquo; from the Castelli 
Romane region. also try the gorgonzola dish they make upon 
request which is an amazing mixture of gorgonzola, balsamic 
vinegar and olives in a spread</li>
<li>L'Arcangelo, via Giuseppe Giaocchinio Belli, 59 - serving 
possibly the best supplis in town, they also serve a delightful 
carbonara in a stylish and fashion environment. a bit expensive, 
but very good.</li>
<li>Roscioli, Via dei Giubbonari, 21 - another great place for 
upscale italian cuisine. everything served is very good food, 
with high quality ingredients. ask for the burrata as a 
starter.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Gelato</h1>

<ul>
<li>Giolitti, Via degli Uffici del Vicario 40, close to the 
Pantheon - one of the oldest gelato places in Rome and a must 
visit for any tourist in town</li>
<li>Il Gelato, Viale Aventino 59 or Piazza Monte Dâ€™Oro - 
particularly well made gelatos with some odd flavors like 
gorgonzola or pear and Port wine. high quality stuff!</li>
<li>Fassi, Via Principe Eugenio, 65 - the oldest gelato place in 
Italy serves cheap gelato and it&rsquo;s a must among the local 
romans. get the metro to Vitorio Emanuele and this place is just 
some meters away.</li>
<li>Gelateria del Teatro, Via di San Simone 70 - doesn&rsquo;t 
have many flavours but has some very original ones (like cherry 
and sage or ricotta and fig). the cioccolato with Nero D'Avola 
flavour is just superb! it is worth just for the lovely place 
where it stands.</li>
<li>Della Palma, via della Maddalena 20, close to the Pantheon - 
has around 100 different flavours so it is worth a visit</li>
<li>Da Quinto, Via di Tor Millina 15, close to Piazza Navona - 
very creamy and soft ice creams</li>
<li>Il Gelato di San Crispino, Via della Panetteria 42 - very 
overrated and not cheap but the &ldquo;merengue&rdquo; gelatti 
are delicious (like gelato with pieces of merengue and 
hazelnuts)</li>
<li>Fior di Luna, Via della Lungaretta, 96 - all flavours taste 
very natural and soft. the crema catalana and hazelnut flavours 
are a must try. they also sell artisanal chocolates!</li>
<li>Gracchi, Via dei Gracchi 272, close to Castel Sant'Angelo - 
apple and cinnamon flavour is one of the best i&rsquo;ve ever 
tried!</li>
<li>Gelarmony, Via Marcantonio Colonna 34, close to Castel 
Sant'Angelo - Sicilian gelato. has some weird citrus flavours of 
traditional sicilian citrus</li>
<li>Ara Coeli, Piazza Ara Coeli, close to Campidoglio - has a 
very good basil and lemon gelato and also try the white 
chocolate and lavender</li>
</ul>
