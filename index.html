      <p>
        Hi! I am André Lamelas, a software engineer with 17 years of
        professional experience doing what I enjoy most: solving problems
        through technology. I love a good challenge and I thrive working with
        complex systems. If you need someone to look at a codebase nobody has
        touched in 10 years and uncover its secrets, that’s me.
